<h1>HTML Slides</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Pretend you're in a &lt;body&gt; tag, just write HTML in each slide's
  file.</li>
  <li>CSS can be loaded in to your presentation using a package.js file in
  presentation/assets</li>
  <li>In the future we will have a way to put a standard Onyx Toolbar at the
  top, such as to unify the slide designs a bit.</li>
</ul>
